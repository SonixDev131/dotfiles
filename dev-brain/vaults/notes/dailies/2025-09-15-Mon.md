## Learning & Notes

### Fish shell
- fish - friendly interactive shell
- Built-in support for syntax highlighting, autosuggestions, and tab completions.
- Change login shell:
  - Add to /etc/shells: `echo $(command -s fish) | sudo tee -a /etc/shells`
  - change shell: `chsh -s $(command -s fish)`
- Scope:
- universal variables:
  - what: variables that persist across all sessions and restarts of the shell.
  - when: useful for setting environment variables or preferences that you want to be consistent across all your fish shell sessions.
  - how: `set -U var_name value`
- global variables:
  - what: persist only for the duration of the current shell session.
  - when: useful for temporary settings or values that you don't need to keep after you close
  - how: `set -g var_name value`

- Export:
- export environment variables:
  - what: environment variables that are inherited by child processes spawned from the shell.
  - when: useful for setting variables that need to be accessible to programs or scripts you run from the shell.
  - how: `set -x var_name value`
- unexport: `-u` or `--unexport`
